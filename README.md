## Introduction

Supported platforms

* **Scout**: skid-steer mobile base
* **Hunter**: ackermann mobile base

This software packages provides a C++ interface to communicate with the mobile platforms from Weston Robot, for sending commands to the robot and acquiring the latest robot state. The SDK works on both x86 and ARM platforms.

Generally, you only need to instantiate an object of the robot base class (such as ScoutBase), then use the object to programmatically control the robot. Internally, the base class manages two background threads, one to process CAN/UART messages of the robot state and accordingly update state variables in the robot state data structure, and the other to maintain a 50Hz loop and send the latest command to the robot base. User can iteratively perform tasks in the main thread and check the robot state or set control commands. 

Refer to "src/apps" for examples.

## Hardware Interface

### Setup CAN-To-USB adapter 
 
1. Enable gs_usb kernel module
    ```
    $ sudo modprobe gs_usb
    ```
2. Bringup can device
   ```
   $ sudo ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 500000
   ```
3. If no error occured during the previous steps, you should be able to see the can device now by using command
   ```
   $ ifconfig -a
   ```
4. Install and use can-utils to test the hardware
    ```
    $ sudo apt install can-utils
    ```
5. Testing command
    ```
    # receiving data from can0
    $ candump can0
    # send data to can0
    $ cansend can0 001#1122334455667788
    ```

Two scripts inside the "./scripts" folder are provided for easy setup. You can run "./setup_can2usb.bash" for the first-time setup and run "./bringup_can2usb.bash" to bring up the device each time you unplug and re-plug the adapter.

### Setup UART

Generally your UART2USB cable should be automatically recognized as "/dev/ttyUSB0" or something similar and ready for use. If you get the error "... permission denied ..." when trying to open the port, you need to grant access of the port to your user accout:

```
$ sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
```

You need to re-login to get the change to take effect.

## Build SDK

### Install dependent libraries

```
$ sudo apt install build-essential cmake
$ sudo apt install libasio-dev
```

### I. Use the package with ROS

```
$ cd <your-catkin-ws>/src
$ git clone https://github.com/westonrobot/wrp_sdk.git
$ cd ..
$ catkin_make
```

### II. Use the package without ROS

If you want to build the TUI monitor tool, additionally install libncurses

```
$ sudo apt install libncurses5-dev
```

Configure and build

```
$ cd wrp_sdk 
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

## Run Demo Apps

The demo code expects one parameter for the CAN bus mode.

```
$ ./app_scout_demo can0
```

Both the port name and baud rate need to be provided when using the RS232 interface.

```
$./app_scout_demo /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
```

If you've installed "libncurses5-dev" and built "app_scout_monitor", you can run it in a similar way:

```
$ ./app_scout_monitor can0
```

or

```
$./app_scout_monitor /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
```

Note: the monitor app is not built by default if you use this SDK with ROS.

## Known Limitations

<!-- 
1. The CAN interface requires the hardware to appear as a CAN device in the system. You can use the command "ifconfig" to check the interface status. For example, you may see something like

    ```
    can1: flags=193<UP,RUNNING,NOARP>  mtu 16
            unspec 00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00  txqueuelen 10  (UNSPEC)
            RX packets 4751634  bytes 38013072 (36.2 MiB)
            RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
            TX packets 126269  bytes 1010152 (986.4 KiB)
            TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
            device interrupt 43
    ```
    
    If you use your own CAN-to-USB adapter, make sure it supports slcan or can be brought up as a native CAN device. Some adapters may use a custom-defined protocol and appear as a serial device in Linux. In such a case, you will have to translate the byte stream between CAN and UART by yourself. It would be difficult for us to provide support for them since not all manufacturers define this protocol in the same way.

1. Release v0.1 of this SDK provided a serial interface to talk with the robot. Front/rear light on the robot cannot be controlled and only a small subset of all robot states can be acquired through that interface. Full support of the serial interface is still under development and requires additional work on both the SDK and firmware sides.
