# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch

  push:
    branches: [ master ]

jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build-melodic:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-18.04
